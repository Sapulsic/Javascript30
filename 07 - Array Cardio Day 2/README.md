# JavaScript30 - Day 7

### **Summary**
Coding Exercises using Arrays.

### **Learned**

* When using console.log to view if the function was a success, you can use {} to show the name of the variable as well in the console.

``javascript
    console.log({isAdult});
``

* We use `Array.prototype.some()` if at least one item in the array meets what it is you are looking for.

* Similar to .some(), we use `Array.prototype.every()` to check if all the items in the array meets what we are looking for.

* Similar to .filter(), we use `Array.prototype.find() to not return the subset of an array but return the first item it finds.
