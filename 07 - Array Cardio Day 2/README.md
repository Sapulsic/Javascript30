# JavaScript30 - Day 7

### **Summary**
Coding Exercises using Arrays Part 2.

### **Learned**

* When using console.log to view if the function was a success, you can use {} to show the name of the variable as well in the console.

```javascript
    console.log({isAdult});
```

* We use `Array.some()` if at least one item in the array meets what it is you are looking for.

* Similar to `.some()`, we use `Array.every()` to check if all the items in the array meets what we are looking for.

* Similar to `.filter()`, we use `Array.find()` to not return the subset of an array but return the first item it finds.

* Learned about `.slice()`, need to look up more information on method.
