### **Summary**
Be able to change the padding and the blur level of a picture.


### **Achieved**


* Learned that `querySelector` returns a __Node List__ and not an array.
* Learned of CSS Variables and that any selectors referencing the variable will be using that variable, examples of CSS Variables such as:

    > `:root`
    > `--className`
    > `property: var(--className)`

* Using `forEach` to listen for change events.
