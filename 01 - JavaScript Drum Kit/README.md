# JavaScript30 - Day 1

### **Summary**
Implement simple sounds that will play when the associated button is pressed.

### **Achieved**
* Each key is represented by a certain number. Adding a window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound); can enable a sound to play when a certain key is pressed.
* When any of the keys are pressed, they make a sound which is enabled from adding ***window.addEventListener('keydown', function(e))***. Each of the keys has their own unique key code. 
* The ability to add and remove a class when the buttons are pushed and released.
* Having sound return when a button is pushed.
